# Heya!
A neat little home page for your browser.

## How to run
1) Clone, and then head into this projects local folder.
2) Run `npm install` from your choice of command line.
3) Configure everything at the top of the index.js file, and run with `npm start`
4) Set, either through it's settings, or extentions, your browsers homepage to localhost:port, where port is the port you specified in the config part.

## Want something?
This project isn't going to be super actively maintained, I'm just using this for my home page, but feel free to submit an issue, clearly labeling it as a feature request. I might add a specific feature-request template later on.

## Something broke!!
Have a quick look over the error, see if you can fix it. If so, nice! Create a pull request to help others out. If that doesn't work, take a quick peek at google or stack overflow. If all else fails, you can submit a bug report. Only reason this is so far down on the list is due to the fact that this is such a small and simple project, and I don't care about it a lot.
